## I saw the idea for the game itself from my friend and I wanted to repeat it, implement my ideas and have some fun.

## The essence of the game
### The essence of the game is quite simple: you need to press the colors in the correct sequence.

### At first glance, it seems that this is quite simple, but the further you go, the more difficult it becomes to memorize the entire sequence, unless you are the owner of a super-memory, of course ðŸ™‚

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
